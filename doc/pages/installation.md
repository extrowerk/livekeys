# Installation

## Windows

On windows, there's a portable version available as a zip file. You can download it from [the downloads section](https://livekeys.io/download).
To install, simply unzip the file, and run livekeys.exe.

## Linux

There are 2 versions of Livekeys for linux in the [downloads section](https://livekeys.io/download). A standalone version,
which doesn't require OpenCV or Qt dependencies, and a version without dependencies, which expects them to be already installed on the system. The standalone version should be more stable, however, due to different versions of ffmpeg and other dependencies already being installed on some systems, the best way to install Livekeys on linux is by compiling
it from source.

## MacOS

On MacOS there's an `.dmg` installer available. After opening, simply drag Livekeys to the Applications folder. 

> Note: To bypass the security warning, right click on the executable, then click open, and click on `Open`.
