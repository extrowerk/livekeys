## The Project View

The project view displays the currently opened project. You can toggle the view on or off by pressing "CTRL+\".
Within the view you can organize your project by adding or renaming folders and files, editing or
[monitoring files](Monitored_Files) and setting the active or main file to run. These actions are available through the
context menu opened by right clicking on an item within the project. Drag and drop is also supported to move files
and folders around.

Files that are opened are shown in bold. If a file isn't saved, it will have the blue dot on top of it's icon, monitored
files will have the eye symbol next to them and active files will have the green arrow.

## The Viewer

The viewer is the place where the build application is displayed. It's a simple item that will fill it's adjusted area.
The viewer does not add any scrollbar by default, so applications will have to include them manually in order to provide
scroll functionality.
