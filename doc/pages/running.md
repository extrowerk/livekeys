# Running Livekeys

When opening Livekeys for the first time, you will be prompted to take a short tour of the application.
The tour will go through the user interfaces and will show you how to create your first project.

The 2 chapters in the tour, together with other tutorials and sample projects are available at the startup
screeen. You can open the startup screen anytime by clicking on the Livekeys logo:

All the tutorials and samples are interactive, and it's the best way to understand how to work with Livekeys.
Each one contains a documentation page, together with a playground to understand each setting.

Each tutorial/sample acts like a Livekeys project, which you can create by yourself. The [projects](projects.md) section explains how projects are structured.
